## Running (Windows/Linux)
Currently txAdmin is included in all FXServer Windows builds above 2310, so to run it for the first time simply double click `FXServer.exe`. After that you could also run the `start_<build>_<profile>.bat` file created, or call it via cmd/bash if you want to edit the ConVars (profile, port, folder).  
If on Linux, you can download the [LATEST BUILD](https://github.com/tabarra/txAdmin/releases/latest) and extract it into the `citizen/system_resources/monitor` folder, or build it from the source.  
  
txAdmin requires to be launched from *inside* FXServer in monitor mode, to do that, just execute the `run.sh` or `run.cmd` without **any** `+exec` arguments.  
  
### ConVars
- **serverProfile:** The name of the server profile to start. Profiles are saved/loaded from the current directory inside the `txData` folder.
- **txAdminPort:** The TCP port to use as HTTP Server.
- **txDataPath:** The path of the data folder. The default on Windows is `<citizen_root>/../txData` and on Linux `<citizen_root>/../../../txData`.
  
ConVar usage **example**:  
```bash
# Windows
./FXServer.exe +set serverProfile dev_server +set txAdminPort 40125 +set txDataPath "%userprofile%/Desktop/txData"

# Linux
./run.sh +set serverProfile dev_server +set txAdminPort 40125 +set txDataPath "~/fxserver/txData"
```

### Installing & Building it (NOT RECOMMENDED)
If you want to run it from source, or build it yourself, please do read [this](docs/building.md).
